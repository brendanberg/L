The L Programming Language is an experimental, minimalist, functional language. The syntax is intended to be straightforward and easy to learn, with the side effect of exposing powerful features in the design. Unlike older languages that inspired it, concurrency is built into the L runtime. The overarching philosophy is that powerful programs should also be concise.
