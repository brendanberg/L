Contributing
============

Contributions to the __L__ Programming Language are welcome and appreciated!
Contributions can range from development to documentation and
everything in between.
Please read this project contribution guide to familiarize yourself with the
project structure and development workflow.

In addition to building a solid programming language, it is also vital that we
create and maintain an inclusive, welcoming, and supportive community.
In short, be courteous, be inquisitive, and don't be a jerk.
You can read more in the [community guidelines][cg].

# Getting Started

The __L__ source is in the `src` directory.
Build dependencies are listed in `package.json`, so you can run `npm install`
in the project directory to install project dependencies.
To build the library, use the `gulp` build tool--just run `gulp build`
from the command line.

# Testing

Tests are in the `test` directory, and there is a gulp task to run them.
Run `gulp test` on the command line.

# What to Work On

A good place to see what needs work is in the [issue tracker][issues].
In the future, there will be a roadmap page in the wiki that discusses new
features and future directions for the language.

Questions, comments, and suggestions can be addressed to
