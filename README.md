# The ðŸ…› Programming Language

The L Programming Language is an experimental, minimalist, functional programming language.
It is designed around the radical philosophy that powerful programs should be concise
and easy to reason about.
Therefore, the syntax is minimal but extensible,
but the language semantics can be extended through a safe macro system.

Because memory management and concurrency are notoriously hard to reason about,
the L runtime provides automatic garbage collection and process communication through message passing.
