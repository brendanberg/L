# The ðŸ…› Programming Language

The L Programming Language is an experimental, minimalist, functional programming language.
It is designed around the radical philosophy that powerful programs should be concise
and easy to reason about.
Therefore, the syntax is minimal but extensible,
but the language semantics can be extended through a safe macro system.

## Installing L

Clone the repository on your machine.
From within the project directory, run the following commands:
